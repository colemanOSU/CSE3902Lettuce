Sprint 2
I am revieweing Kelly Coleman's code for Link.cs

Overall, the code for the Link class looks really good. It is simple and easy to follow. A hypothetical change would be using a SpriteFactory to make the code more cohesive with the enemy code in the game. I would also find a way to put the class into a folder for more organiation. There is a Damaged function that I am not sure if it is there to make the compiler happy or can be removed. I would reccomend adding a comment if it is necessary similar to the other empty functions.
