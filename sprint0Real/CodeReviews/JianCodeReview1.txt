Sprint 2
I'm reviewing Allen's code for DragonBehavior.cs
It took 10 minuites to finish this review

For a complicated boss monster it is suprisingly simple how the basic dragon behavior works. While the file as a whole
is complicted and a bit daunting to understand as long as you follow the steps from the update method at the bottom, the 
whole file comes together much easier. The only minor thing I would change would be to switch SafeJuke and JukeCheck as 
it would make reading the file as a whole easier as it would follow the update method from the top to bottom of the cs file.
I really like how all the variables and magic numbers(game border and doubling) make sense(once you understand what juke is for).
