Sprint 2
I'm reviewing Ariv's code for SwordUseRight.cs
This review took me about 5 minutes

The code is very simple to understand, it draws the sword sprite in a projectile toward the right side of link upon an boolean called isMoving. There are 3 other files that performs similar actions but goes in the other three directions. I would suggest in the future maybe put all 4 in the same file and use the Link.GetFacing() function in the Link class to identify which direction the sword flys toward. Overall the code has very good readability and maintainability
