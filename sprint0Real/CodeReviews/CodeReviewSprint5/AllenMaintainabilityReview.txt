I'm reviewing Jian's code for CheatCommand.cs
About 5 minutes to complete

The code for CheatCommand seems to be pretty maintainable, as long as someone with 
a decent understanding of algorithms/queues maintains it. Modifying the code would probably
be as simple as changing the numbers that are in the ans array so that seems pretty easy. One
problem that might arise is that that code doesn't seem to be able to interpret repeated commands, 
meaning that if someone wants additional key presses for a cheat code that might require modifying 
other classes outside the cheatcommand, which might be tedious/difficult
