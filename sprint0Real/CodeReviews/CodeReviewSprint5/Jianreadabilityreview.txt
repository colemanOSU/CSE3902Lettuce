While there are some obvious critiques like adding comments to explain whats 
going on, one thing that I is really important is to create more methods for 
update to execute instead of putting all the code into updates, not only will 
that make updating the game in the future easier but it would also make it easier 
to understand each part and funtion separelty instead of putting all of it together 
like link's phases and damage reaction. While phases is a bit vague without knowing what 
it is, the vaiable names you've given are all really good, reading the code was't that 
hard to disect due to being easily able to know what each varible is.
