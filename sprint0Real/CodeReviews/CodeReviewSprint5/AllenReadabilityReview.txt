Sprint 5
I'm reviewing Jian's code for CheatCommand.cs
About 5 minutes to complete

The code is pretty readable, with most of the stuff contained being algorithms like
iterating over a queue and using that to determine what direction a fireball should be 
fired. The function names are easy to interpret and helps to understand the code that 
is contained in each function. One thing that might be improved for readability might
be to replace the magic numbers that are used in the ans array with some array of enum values
so it is easier to understand what the ans numbers represent, but that's about all the 
critiques I can think of.
