Overall I would rate the readability of this class very highly. The constructor logically sets up textures, screen size, and sprite positions, making it easy to follow. 
The Draw method also logically divides steps, which aids in clarity and makes it easier to follow. Some minor things I would change to make the class more readable is to 
add comments. Specifically the Flash Logic, "showWhiteFlash ((int)(flashElapsedTime / flashDuration) % 2 == 0)", could use a comment to explain the logic better. Apart from 
that line comments could help throughout any class, however everything else is plenty readable without.
