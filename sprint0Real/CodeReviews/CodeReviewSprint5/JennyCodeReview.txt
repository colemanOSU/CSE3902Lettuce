I'm reviewing Kelly's code for BeamSprite.cs
This review took me about 10 minutes

READABILITY:
This file is pretty readable, all the variables are named properly and 
their purposes are clear(examples would be StartSource, MidSource, etc). 
The class is also small enough so all the components are clear to see,
the draw and update functions are also easy to follow with some 
comments. I don't think I have anything to add on this, it is very
easy to follow and know what everything is doing.

MAINTAINABILITY:
This file is decently maintainable, the only thing I think I
can talk about is the magic numbers, putting them into constant variables
will probably make the class more maintainable, but in this context I think
it is okay to just leave them out, and I do that too. Overall I think this 
class is very maintainable.
