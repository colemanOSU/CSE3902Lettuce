I don't mean to be dour, but surely manually initializing each element of the dictionary char -
Rectangle dictionary way not the play. You already have an array of the chars defined! Treat 
yourself and set up a for-each loop with the Rectangle offsets determined by the row and column
indices. Not very maintainable as is!

Overall, I don't think I can score this code particularly high in the maintainability aspect.
Much of it seems to be hard-coded to fit the exact layout as it is now; I can't imagine that the
English language is getting any new letters soon so it's not that terrible, but should you wish
to adjust your layout or available symbols later, there will be Hell on Earth.

Having any keyboard control happen in this class is an absolute no-no from me. If I were grading
the maintainability on a 10-point scale, that choice alone would have knocked down my score by 
at least two points. 

It works, and for various reasons I assume nobody will be touching this code in two weeks time
so it isn't really a problem, but I think this code overall gets a thumbs down from me
on the sustainability front.
