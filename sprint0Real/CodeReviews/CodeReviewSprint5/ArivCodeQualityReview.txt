SPRINT: 5
TIME TAKEN: 25 Minutes

Jenny has had consisitently high code quality over the last few sprints that I have reviewed her code. In WinningState.cs, this is consistent. 
Some pros of her Code Quality is her use of constants like "animationTotalDuration" and "flashDuration" to improve maintainability. She also 
used existing sprite classes, specifically "PickUpSprite" and "Triforce" instead of hardcoding logic, which helps with reuse with other items 
that get picked up. I don't like the use of magic numbers in her code, but that is a minor issue and very common in this class I would guess. 
Another issue is "Game1" is passed into the class, and there are a few tightly coupled methods like "game.ResetGame()" that discourage reusability.
