I mean it's alright. I think this code's greatest barrier to fluent readability is a lack of
descriptive naming schemes. Lots of very generic variable names like "pos" and "x", "y", which
might suffice if the code were laden with descriptive and illustrative comments, but without
only serves to muddle to purpose of the code. The fact that functionality that objectively
should not be handled within the class is here only helps obfuscate the code's purpose and
makes tracing through it a, and pardon my French here, real pain in the oiseaux.

It would not take too much to save this code. A quick passing over to rename some variables, a
touching up of comments, and the quick and immediate seperation of functionality into seperate
classes where they belong, and this code would be as good as new. Until that day comes however,
I have no choice but to give this code a mild thumbs down for readability.
