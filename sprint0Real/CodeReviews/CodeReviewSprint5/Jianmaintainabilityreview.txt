This code is suprisingly maintainable dispite its unreadability. The use of variables and switch cases allow for modularity
and allow for wasy additions to new phases or other Colors depending on links situation. One last change to your code would be to get rid 
of magic numbers and change stuff like 0.2 to variables like timeIncriment. Other than that I would proabaly sugest adding code to other methods 
instead of cramming every code into update making fixing, adding, and debugging code much simpler in the future.
