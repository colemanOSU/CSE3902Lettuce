I'm reviewing Ariv's code for WeaponSwordSprite.cs
About 5 minutes to complete

While the code seems pretty maintainable one thing that sticks out to me is the use of magic numbers, while it is fine for our purposues as it is meant 
to be played in the popup as is. However if anthing were to change in scale you would need to redo all your magic numbers so that it would look good on 
link. an easy fix would be changing x3 into a variable like scaleing=3 and multiplying it by a scaling factor. Not only that but you could change the vector into 
a variable like beamSpeed=300 rather than just using 300
