I'm reviewing Jian's code for BTrap.cs
About 10 minutes to complete

This review is on MAINTAINABILITY

I think the BTrap class is doing well with maintainability by using a state machine and behavior logic to separate the big chunks which allows future maintainability and testing.
There is only one spot that has magic numbers but I think it is completely fine, one suggestion I would think of is storing the number into a variable to reduce magic numbers.
