I'm reviewing Jian's code for BTrap.cs
About 10 minutes to complete

This review is on READABILITY

for readability, overall it is pretty clear what everything is doing, the variable names are good except for the upper and lower case location. 
This may cause some confusions while reading the code, so my suggestion would be change the 'private Vector2 Location' to 'public Vector2 Location { get; set; }' and use the variable name Location throughout the file.
