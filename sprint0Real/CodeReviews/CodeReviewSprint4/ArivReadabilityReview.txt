Sprint 4
This review took me around 10 minutes.
I am revieweing Jenny's code TitelScreen.cs for Readability

This file was written in a previous sprint but was rewritten by Jenny to fit with parts of the game implemented in this sprint.

This class is solid when it comes to Readability. Some strengths for readability in Jenny's code is that most variables and methods
have descriptive names. This is also consistent with the methods, which are well-organized with good logical flow. It is very easy to 
tell what is going on throughout the class, however it may be beneficial to add some comments through the class to increase readability
even further.
