In terms of readability, this file is perfectly fine. Variables are named appropriately and succinctly.
The file is generally well organized and easy enough to read through. The largest obstacle to this file's
readability is its somehwat peculiar logic. Lots of checking if something is an Object type and then assigning
it a string of that object type; it certainly seems to work, but is just somewhat offputting on a first read
as you wonder why it is done that way. Otherwise unremarkable.
