Well. This file does not mainly mark as maintainable, mostly. This functionality of obtaining a string
corresponding to an Object's type... there has to be an easier way to implement it. There must be. As it
is now you'd have to go into this file and manually add a new conditional and string for every new object
type you wish to add into the game. No good!!! Even just having a function inherited by all interfaces that
returns the name of the type would have to be preferable to this. Overall this file gets a thumbs down from me on maintainability :(.
