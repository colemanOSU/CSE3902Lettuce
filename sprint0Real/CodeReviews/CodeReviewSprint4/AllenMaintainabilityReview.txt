I'm reviewing Kelly's code for MenuUI.cs
About 5 minutes to complete

The comments that are scattered throughout the document do help to understand what the code is doing, but more could be done. For example, in the Draw function there exists 
a conditional that goes 5 levels deep. Some of the conditional statements inside should be moved into separate functions so the code is more readable and maintainable. 
The large number of magic numbers also make it hard to understand what each are doing, meaning that modifying location would become more challenging.
