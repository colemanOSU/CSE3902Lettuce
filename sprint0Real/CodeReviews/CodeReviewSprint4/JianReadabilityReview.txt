I'm reviewing Ariv's code for WeaponSwordSprite.cs
About 3 minutes to complete(after other review)


While I can understand what the code is doing by reading each line, the overall readablilty needs a bit of imporvement as some variables are hard to
understand without context or testing. One thing that would help a lot are comments on what each part is doing would make it a lot more readable to those 
who arn't too familiar with how the weopons items work in the code. as at a glance the code is too confusing to be understood. ex(why is isDelaying = true; when timer is <5)
