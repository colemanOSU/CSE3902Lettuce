Sprint 4
This review took me around 20 minutes.
I am revieweing Jenny's code TitelScreen.cs for Maintainability

This file was written in a previous sprint but was rewritten by Jenny to fit with parts of the game implemented in this sprint.

This class is solid when it comes to code quality. The class uses the GameStates enum to manage the transitions between the game states, 
which is a strength in terms of maintainability. Another strength is that the animation logic is easily modified. Some areas for improvement
are the magic numbers used. These numbers could be declared as seperate variables prior to using them as magic numbers. Another weakness is 
the Game1 paramater is passed during the update method rather than the constructor.
