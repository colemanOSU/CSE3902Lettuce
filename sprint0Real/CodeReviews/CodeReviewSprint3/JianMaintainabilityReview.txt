This is very similar to how the enemies are put onto the map so I was able to easily able to understand this file quickly. This is very maintainable, 
It is designed to be able to add and remove stuf from the cirrent staging of the map and can easily add new objects and be able to remove them. 
The only critique that I would add would to ensure that the physical wall should not be hard coded as stuff like dungeon walls(the border) will not 
have proper hitboxes as they cover the whole screen while they can't use AddBorderWalls() b/c the walls are hard coded for the outside border only.
