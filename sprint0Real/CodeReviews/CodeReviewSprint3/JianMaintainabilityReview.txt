In terms of readability, this file is not bad at all. If there was an area to critique, one might wish for slightly more informative comments, 
particularly in regards to each individual process's role in the overall journey. Yet this is a relatively minor complaint. Variables are 
generally well named and the class well organized enough.The jury of 1 is still out on the decision to have collision handling done through an
XML file, but progress moves steadily on like a mammoth glacier which no man can cease nor slow. Overall unremarkable readability.
