Sprint 2
I'm reviewing Jian's code for Hand.cs
About 5 minutes to complete

The code is pretty clean. The code added since last time is mostly the same minus a few extra lines and the lines work. The only worries that I have is that the work might 
not be used in the future. This can be easily changed by just moving the contents of hitwall into some other command so that when a wall is hit, instead of calling hitwall,
just changes direction.
