This review took me around 20 minutes.
I am revieweing Allen's LevelLoader.cs

Overall I think this code looks really good, it parses the XML where the data is stored. The class is also fairly consice and does not rely on a lot of outside classes.
I also like how it uses a singleton pattern to ensure there is only one loader. One thing I would add to this class is error handling since it is loading a file in case 
something isn't put together as we planned. You could also define constants at the start of the file for the attribute names such as 
"private const string ATTR_TYPE = "Type"" and use the const when getting the attributes.
