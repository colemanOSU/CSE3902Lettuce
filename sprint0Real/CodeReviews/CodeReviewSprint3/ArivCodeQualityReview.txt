Sprint 3
This review took me around 10 minutes.
I am revieweing Jenny's code ItemStateMachine.cs for Code Quality

This file was written in a previous sprint but was rewritten by Jenny to fit with parts of the game implemented in this sprint.

This class is solid when it comes to code quality. The class uses enum to hold the items link can use very well and makes it easy to cycle 
through useable items. The switch expression is also very nice and simple. Another plus is that the function DrawWeaponSprite ensures that old
weapon objects are removed before adding new ones. I do have a few critiques though. It may be be beneficial to seperate itemStateMachine from
GameStateMachine and create a seperate GameStateMachine to handle functions like setActive and DrawWeaponSprite. Another much smaller critique 
is the magic numbers.
