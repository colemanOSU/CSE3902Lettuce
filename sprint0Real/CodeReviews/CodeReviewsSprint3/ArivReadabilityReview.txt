Sprint 3
This review took me around 10 minutes.
I am revieweing Jenny's code ItemStateMachine.cs for Readability

This file was written in a previous sprint but was rewritten by Jenny to fit with parts of the game implemented in this sprint.

This class is solid when it comes to readability. The initial comment makes it very easy to understand the goal of the class and the well named
variables make it easy to follow what is going on through each line of code. Jenny also included lines that write to the console depending on different 
things occuring during the game, making it even easier to follow what is going on. Although it is very time consuming my only critique would be to add more 
comments throughout the class specifying what is going on in different parts of the code for people who may not be able to follow solely by the variable
names, but it is not necessary and a very minor critique.
