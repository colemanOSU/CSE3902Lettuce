This file is functional, and as a bottom-level sprite class, there is not too much to
worry about in terms of future functionality requiring good maintainability from this
class. The only future functionality that may rely on this class's maintainability
that I can think of is colision.

The single biggest change I can suggest to improve maintainability is the same 
suggestion I made to improve readbility: Instead of rendering a portion of the Link 
Holding [Weapon] Sprite, why not simply render the isolated sword itself behind Link
and move it back back and forth? The biggest gains I can see in terms of
maintainability for this change would be to make it much easier to implement new items
in the future and it could possibly simplify future colision/hit detection by allowing
the hitbox to be a simple subset of the rendering box instead of having to create a
new colison hitbox for each weapon.
