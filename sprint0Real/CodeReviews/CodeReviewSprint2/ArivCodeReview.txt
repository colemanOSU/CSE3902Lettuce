This review took me around 10 minutes.
I am revieweing Andrea Stewart's code for PreviousBlockCommand.cs

Overall the code for PreviousBlockCommand.cs is well written and easy to read, however there are some suggestions I would make in terms
of code quality. It may be benificial to replace the dictionary with an enum to avoid hardcoded indices/magic numbers, and this would 
also have the benefit of making your code more readable. It also may be beneficial to put in a check or default behavior for _currentBlock
in the case that it doesn't have a valid key.
