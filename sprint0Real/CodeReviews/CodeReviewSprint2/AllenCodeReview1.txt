I'm reviewing Jian's code for BTrapBehavior.cs
About 5 minutes to complete


For the most part the code is pretty good. Some personal suggestions I have could be 
in the future might be to add some more distinction between the functionalities of the separate classes,
along with implementing either some enum class or something equivalent so that there are not random
magic numbers floating around that are responsible for the different states, as that makes it pretty hard to read.
The change shouldn't be too difficult as it should only involve making another enum class and importing 
that and doing some CTRL+F and replacing for the most part.
