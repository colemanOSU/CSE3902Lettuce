This file's readability is quite poor; it may of well been written by a numerologist
for all the magic numbers it has, and switch statements abound. This is somewhat an
invetability when writing these sprite specific classes, but can improvements can be
made regardless. 

The single biggest change I can suggest to improve readability is the same suggestion
to improve maintainability: Instead of rendering a portion of the Link Holding 
[Weapon] Sprite, why not simply render the isolated sword itself behind Link and move
it back back and forth? This would drastically reduce the amount of magic numbers in 
the code (since you would render from the same sourcerectangle each time) and would 
drastically reduce the amount of in-line math and multiplication needed to render the
sprites (since you would be using one sprite moving in a predicatble manner). 

Additionally, greater care could be taken to provide informative variable names. The
"flag" boolean is the most egregious example of this, but variables such as "_timer"
could also serve to be renamed.

I would also reccomend having one spriteBatch.Draw statement and having the
SpriteEffect parameter be set to SpriteEffects.FlipHorizontally or null within the
greater switch statement.
