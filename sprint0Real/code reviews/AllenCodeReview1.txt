I'm reviewing Jian's code.

For the most part the code is pretty good. Some personal suggestions I have could be 
in the future might be to add some more distinction between the functionalities of the separate classes,
along with implementing either some enum class or something equivalent so that there are not random
magic numbers floating around that are responsible for the different states.
