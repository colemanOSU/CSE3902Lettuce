Sprint 5 Reflection
As we reached the end of this sprint, our team reflected on the progress we made and the challenges we faced. While we completed many of the features we set out to build—like implementing new enemies, new power ups, dungeon resets, and an achievements system—we also recognized areas where our process still has room to grow.
One improvement this sprint was how we divided responsibilities. Although our task distribution wasn’t perfect, it was better than in previous sprints. More members took on individual features and systems, which allowed us to make progress. However, there was still a variety of work put in by group members. In future collaborative projects, we’d benefit from being more intentional and transparent about who is working on what.
Communication was another mixed area. We had some helpful discussions and planning meetings, but there were also points where lack of communication led to redundant work or late rework. More frequent short syncs and clearer documentation could help address this moving forward. We could improve communication about individual responsibilities so that each member has a better understanding of the game and how the different elements work together.
A positive change we made this sprint was trying to work in smaller chunks and get things integrated sooner rather than waiting until the end. This helped with testing and gave us more time to polish features and fix bugs. It also allowed for more visible progress throughout the sprint, which helped keep motivation up.
Overall, while we still had some process issues, this sprint showed noticeable improvement. We’re proud of how far the project came and the functionality we were able to implement, and we’ve all grown as developers and teammates through the experience. If we had more time we would implement more features and focus on refactoring and cleaning up our code such as the game state handling.
